All induvidual .hmtl files are within the Repositry. 

All .html files are commented, and are the same in code structure, so don't get confused with which one is which.

All contain the example code for implimenting appropriate output to the database within Restdb.io.

All necessary data would be stored within the restdb.io database.

Codehooks provided are within a .js format.

These would be within the restdb.io database, and call the appropriate functions.

Slack API URLs need to be inserted into the appropriate variables.

Within End Entity Codehook, appropriate file path would need to be added within the afterPOST function.
